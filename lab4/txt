Instructions to fixing files for tasks 2,3,4. Where there are multiple arguments, press enter after each one.

task 2-
look up the adress of _start with readelf -s deep_thought in the terminal
set unit size to 4 (menu-3, then 4)
insert that adress with the bytes in reverse into the buffer with memory modify (menu- 8, then 0, [_start adress]). To clarify, we were given adress 08048156 by the command- insert it as 56810408.
set file name to "deep_thought" (menu-2, then deep_thought)
put the buffer into the file with offset 18 (menu- 7, then 0,18,1)
quit (menu-9)

 
task 3-
enter readelf -s offensive into the terminal
calculate the offset of main, or just use the value we found- 41d
run hexeditplus ./hexeditplus
set the filename- menu-2 ,then offensive
insert c3 to the memorybuffer (menu- 8 then 0, c3)
put the buffer into the file with offset 41d (7, then 0, 41d, 1)

task4 -
enter readelf -S ntsc into the terminal
see .text address ant offset -both are 410 (the function is in text section)
enter readelf -s ntsc into the terminal
see digit_cnt address - 577
calculate section_file_offset + function_virtual_address - section_virtual_address:
410+577-410 = 577

enter readelf -S task4 into the terminal
see .text address ant offset -both are 3f0 (the function is in text section)
enter readelf -s ntsc into the terminal
see func address - 4ed
see func size - 99
calculate location : 3f0+4ed-3f0=4ed

run hexeditplus ./hexeditplus
set the filename- menu-2 ,then task4
load relevant part into buffer- 4, then  4ed, 99 
set the filename- menu-2 ,then ntsc
enter to the menu- 7, 0, 577, 99
